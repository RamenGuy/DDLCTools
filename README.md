# DDLCTools
A simple set of Python GUI-based tools that can make modding with DDLC a little bit easier.
Currently contains a tool for making easy conversations using [Elckarow's EMR phone](https://github.com/Elckarow/Phone) call system, and a system for quickly adding poem words.
Feel free to suggest additions!
