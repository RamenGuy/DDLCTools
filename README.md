# DDLCTools
A simple set of Python GUI-based tools that can make modding with DDLC a little bit easier.

Currently contains:
* A tool for making easy conversations using [Elckarow's EMR phone](https://github.com/Elckarow/Phone) call system.
* A tool for quickly adding poem words.

Plans:
* Add a tool for making Elckarow's EMR phone GCs easily (Done, but not released fully)
* Add a tool for previewing Mood Pose Tool poses, and easily adding your own attributes (In progress)
 
Feel free to suggest additions!
